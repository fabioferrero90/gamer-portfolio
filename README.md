# Gamer Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website i'm creating for me, it shows my web dev skills and will use ReactJS as the main framework.
Would be a gaming inspired website, including mentions to what I thought were the best games in history or those that marked my journey as a gamer the most.


**Plans:**

- [✅] Create a Loading Screen
- [✅] Create a Main Menu page inspired to Zelda: BOTW to "Start the Game"
- [] Create a "Game Intro" inspired to Elder Scrolls: Skyrim (You're Finally Awake)
- [] Create an interactive "Game Map" inspired to Pokemon GameBoy Games
- [] Create an interactive RPG inspired "HUD" with menus
- [] Create an inventory page as a "Skills" page
- [] Add NPC mechanics to talk with
- [] Add a "Save Game" system
- [] Create a Quests page as a "Completed Projects" and "Ongoing Projects" page
- [✅] Create a 404 page inspired to "Dark Souls (You're Dead)"
- [] Create a "Credits" page 
- [] Add a transition system between different pages
- [] Create an Achievement system
- [] Add "Boomer mode" to show the website as a plain website
- [] Add Madness
